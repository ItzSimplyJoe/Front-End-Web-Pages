# Front End WebPages ðŸ’»
## Contents
Currently inside of this repository there are '2' different websites.

### Website 1 | Login and Signup
Simple Login and sign up front end. No backend included, just a simple, clean modern interface. If you wish to add backend i would reccommend that you use NodeJS and link in a database of some kind.

### Website 2 | Portfolio Page
My portfolio website. Can be customised and used for yourself if you really want to. Its not amazing, the photos are terrible and most of them are stolen from google.

##More will be added
